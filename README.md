# Movies Catalog

This is a pet project for non commercial use. The only purposes are learning how to develop applications and demonstrate my skills

Catalog uses TMDB API for fetching movies data so you need to get API key [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) and then go to `Installation` section to successfully run the project

## Installation

1. Install all dependencies executing in the shell `npm install`
2. Set up the environment variables
   1. Execute in the shell `cp config.example.ts config.ts`
   2. Define all of required variables in the freshly created `config.ts` file
